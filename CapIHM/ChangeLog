	* emulation core : now when the emulator have nothing to do, he make
	usleep() instead of do loop, this reduce the CPU usage, speed up
	program with lower priority then caprice and make the sleeps states of
	CPU to be active.
	* GUI : now there are an AboutBox, in menu, the Reset works, had the
	actually working shortcut, and make a Registers Dialog for the Debug
	Mode (Actually open but not working).
