A compiled version of the examples can be found in the /examples/bin directory.

Under GNU/Linux, depending on your system, you may need to rebuild the library
and the examples. To do so, type make in this /src directory and type make in 
the /examples directory.

To recompile AntTweakBar and the examples you also need the following external 
libraries:
- GLFW : http://glfw.sourceforge.net - for convenience a Windows version is 
         included in the /examples directory
- GLUT : http://opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut - the windows version can 
         be found at http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html
- SDL  : http://www.libsdl.org
(and the DirectX SDK if you want to recompile the Windows lib & DX examples)
