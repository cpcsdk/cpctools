Roadmap
-------

The COPYING file contains a copy of the GPL described above.

NEWS and ChangeLog describe differences between versions.


Description
-----------

aylet plays music files in the `.ay' format. These files are
essentially wrappers around bits of Z80 code which play music on the
Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128's sound hardware - either the beeper, or
(eponymously) the AY-3-8912 sound chip. Files using the Amstrad CPC
ports are also supported.

`aylet' has a curses-based interface, and `xaylet' has an X-based one.

One source of `.ay' files playable with aylet/xaylet is "Project AY"
on the World of Spectrum website:

Installation
------------

You'll need an ANSI C compiler. `gcc' is fine - so should most other
compilers be, these days.

If you're running Linux, the Makefile should be ok; if not, you might
want to check it. After doing that (or not :-)), you should do `make'
(or `make aylet' if you don't have GTK+ installed), then (as root)
`make install'.

Once it's installed, don't forget to read the man page for further
documentation.
