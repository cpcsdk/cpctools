0) About CPCTools
-----------------

This package contains a few tools that we created during my CPC development.
Most of them work at least in Haiku, Linux and Windows.

There are general tools like file manager or image viewer and purely
developement oriented tools like Dams converter, data linker or snapshot
creator.

All the sources are in C++ (and a bit commented but mainly in french, sorry for
english guys !).

WARNING : all these tools are under developpement ! bug report & remark will be
appreciated ! (This is also the case for this small doc)

1) LibCPC
---------

The LibCPC includes tools for DSK and SNA file management. It uses LibDSK from
John Eliott which we are also distributing in this package (any version should
work).

A libdskrc file is also included to add support for some common custom formats
used on CPC.

2) CPCFS
--------

This tool takes a .dsk and manage file on this .dsk. Getting/putting with
binary mode & on the fly header creation. There are few options and only 3 file
systems managed (DATA, SYSTEM and ROMDOS D1). 

cpcfs <disc> <command> [option] [file *] [-s]
Commands :
        c  : catalogue
        f  : disc format
        p  : put file
             -ch : header creation when putting
             -b : binary mode
        g  : get file
             -nh : no header when getting
        ga : get all file
             -nh : no header when getting
        r  : rename file
        d  : delete file
        i  : print disc info
        h  : print file header
Options
        -s : select side B

When putting or getting files, you can use [<user>:]name.ext[,S][,P][,start][,exec]

Examples :
Putting a file on the DSK
	cpcfs myDisk.dsk p myFile

Putting a binary file and create header (start 0x1000 and exe 0x1050) on the
fly:
	cpcfs myDisk.dsk p myFile.bin,0x1000,0x1050

I originally created this tool under Linux and there you can use it with a real
3'5 disk !
	cpcfs /dev/fd0 c

There is also limited support for usb floppy drives (only the ROMDOS D1 format
will work as it is the most similar to the PC 720K format)
	cpcfs /dev/sdb c

It might work also under windows using the libdsk extension fdrawcmd.sys
(WARNING ! Use at your own risk !)
	cpcfs a: c

3) CPCFSExt
-----------

This is a shell extension for Windows Explorer. It adds a new "CPCFS tools"
context menu on right clicking of file, .dsk or directory.
What CPCFSExt does on right clicking :
	
	a. Background
		- Create...
			Create a new DSK in the current directory, default
			format is Data 40 tracks
		- Create ??.dsk
			Create a new DSK using current directory name, default
			format is Data 40 tracks
	
	b. DSK file (single selection) (if the file is not a .dsk, you can't get
	this context menu !)
		- Extract all to...
			Extract all files (keeping header) to a given directory
		- Extract all here
			Extract all files (keeping header) to current directory
		- Extract to ??\
			Extract all files (keeping header) to directory named
			like ??.dsk
		- Catalogue
			Display a catalogue interface of the current .dsk
		- Disc Info
			Display disc information of the current .dsk
		- Send to A:
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		- Send to CPCBooster
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		- Format
			Format current .dsk using dsk format specification (all
			file deleted !)
	
	c. DSK file (mutiple selection) (if one file is not a dsk, you can't get
	this context menu !)
		- Extract all to directories
			Extract all file of each .dsk to directory named like
			??.dsk
		- Extract all here
			Extract all file of each .dsk to current directory
			
	d. File (single selection and multiple selection)
		- Add to...
			Add current file(s) to a given .dsk (no header created
			on the fly)
		- Add to ??.dsk
			Add current file(s) to a dsk name like current directory
			(no header created on the fly)
		- Send to A:
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		- Send to CPCBooster
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		
		If the file is a binary file (single selection only) :
		- Edit header
			Display a interface to edit AMSDOS file header (start
			address & execution address)
		- Remove header
			Remove AMSDOS file header
		
		If the file is not a binary file (single selection only) :
		- Add header
			Display a interface to add AMSDOS file header (start
			address & execution address)
	
	e. Directory (single selection)
		- Add all file to...
			Add all file in directory to a given .dsk (no header
			created on the fly)
		- Add all file to ??.dsk
			Add all file in directory to a .dsk named like selected
			directory (no header created on the fly)
	
	f. Directory (multiple selection)
		- Add all file to *.dsk
			For each directory, add all file in directory to a .dsk
			named like current directory (no header created on the
			fly)

This is a first release. If you think there is some missing functionnality,
please contact me. I'm also looking on explorer namespace extension in order to
use .dsk like directories (drag & drop, rename, etc... inside explorer). It
seems to be possible, but I haven't already start the development, if you are
interested, please contact me.

4) CPCFileViewer
----------------

Include a lib and a executable. The lib use SDL for displaying.

* cpcFileViewer :
This tools load the file and display it using a standard CPC video mode. It can
load screen, windows and font file data. It manage also OCP file format .SCR and
.WIN (including compressed one) as well as .PAL (when loading myScreen.SCR, it
try to find a myScreen.PAL). If the tools detect a standard CPC header, it's
automatically remove it in order to display only binary data of the loaded file.

In all mode :
	CTRL + left / right 	: change CRTC R1 value
	CTRL + up / down 	: change CRTC R6 value
	F1 			: switch to screen display mode
	F2 			: switch to window display mode
	F3 			: switch to font display mode
	0,1,2 			: change video mode

In Window display mode :
	left / right 		: change width of window
	up / down 		: change height of window
	
In Font display mode :
	left / right 		: change width of a single character
	up / down 		: change height of a single character
	SHFT + left / right 	: change the number of character displayed
	v / h 			: switch between vertical and horizontal display
				of each character
	
usage : cpcFileViewer myScreen.scr

Remark : under windows, assign .SCR and .WIN to be opened using cpcFileViewer
and you can run it directly under Explorer by double clicking on .SCR or .WIN
files.

* libVideoCPC :
You can use this lib to display your data in CPC video mode. It's include a
CPCVideo object creation and many method on this object (putting / getting
byte, window, pixel, etc...). It also include a small SDL management over
CPCVideo screen (see source code for example ! ;).

Remark : this lib can easily be use to create a drawing tool, but it need to be
include in a real GUI, and I don't plan to make these development yet.

5) createSnapshot
-----------------

This tools can create and modify a emulator .SNA file. 
During developement I use this tool to create .SNA file containing datas,
graphics and code. Using a config file (or command line option) you can easily
create an auto executable .SNA file i.e when you load it under an emulator,
it's automatically start.

Usage : createSnapshot <filename.sna> [-i $1] [-l $1 $2]* [-p $1 $2]* [-s $1 $2]
* [-x] [-r] [-e] [-d] [-c $1] [-t] [-h]

Create a Amstrad CPC snapshot <filename.sna>
Default snapshot : 6128, CRTC 0, rom deconnected, no interrupt, CRTC standard value

        -i <$1> | --inSnapshot <$1>
                Load <$1> snapshot file
        -l <$1> <$2> | --loadFileData <$1> <$2>
                Load <$1> file data at <$2> address in snapshot memory
        -p <$1> <$2> | --putData <$1> <$2>
                Put <$1> byte at <$2> address in snapshot memory
        -s <$1> <$2> | --setToken <$1> <$2>
                Set snapshot token <$1> to value <$2>
                Use <$1>:<val> to set array value
                ex '-s CRTC_REG:6 20' : Set CRTC register 6 to 20
        -x | --clearMemory
                Clear snapshot memory
        -r | --romDeconnect
                Deconnect lower and upper rom
        -e | --enableInterrupt
                Enable interrupt
        -d | --disableInterrupt
                Disable interrupt
        -c <$1> | --configFile <$1>
                Load a config file with createSnapshot option
        -t | --tokenList
                Display setable snapshot token ID
        -h | --help
                Display help

8) dataLinker
-------------

This tool pack many input data file in one or more output data file. It's also
enerate a source file with right data definition. It automatically organize data
in order to minimize memory usage (according to data address masking)

Usage : dataLinker <-z $1 $2 $3 $4>+ <-d $1 $2 $3>+ [-o $1] [-c $1] [-h]
Link data and create a .z80 file

;*********************************************

9) AFT
--------

the Arkos File Transfer server.

This program listens on a COM port for commands coming from a CPC with the CPC
Booster expansion and the Arkos ROM. It allows the CPC to exchange (download and
upload) files with your PC (or other computer).

Visit the Arkos webpage for more information on the ROM:
			http://arkos.cpcscene.com

10) ZMac
-----------

The z80 macro assembler.

This is an usual macro assembler. Not much more to say about it.
                
10) Other tools
--------------

In the 'tools' directory you can find 'optionParser.h' and 'optionParser.c'.
Theses function are used to manage command line option parsing (using a simple
option structure description). You can also reuse this piece of code ! ;)

11) Future developpement
------------------------

Continue to make these tools better and better (error management, additionals
options, ...)

Make a global SDK for CPC . For example :
	- text editing under Notepad / UltraEdit / Crimson editor / VC++
	- source code compiling using ZMac (and maybe linking ?), with symbol
		table & break point exporting
	- snapshot generation from datas using config file
	- automatic running of .SNA under emulator (WinApe or Arnold or ?) and
		using symbol table and breaking in a debugging phase
	- automatic running of .SNA on real CPC using CPCBooster + Arkos tools :)

I think we have a good base of tools to do this SDK, but we need to package all
this in a single SDK...
	
11) License
-----------

You can use these tools freely. 
You can also modify all source code or include them into your own production
(small credit will be enough ! ;).
