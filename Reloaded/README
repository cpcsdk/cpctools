WHAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~

Reloaded is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8bit home computer
series. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128
models. By recreating the operations of all hardware components at a low
level, the emulator achieves a high degree of compatibility with original
CPC software. These programs or games can be run unmodified at real-time
or higher speeds, depending on the emulator host environment.

Reloaded is based on a fork of Caprice32, but nearly every part was
rewritten from scratch.
